testing code examples
components:
    refer to navigationItems component, here there are 2,3 method utilisations example.

containers: 
    refer BurgerBuilder container, here we have tested the buger loading buildcontrols.
    simulation of click events is more complicated, hence we need to test only what we need.

    Note: here inorder to detach the containers from redux. we export it as a named export, that way we can omit the 
    redux connect functionality.

reducers:
    refer Auth reducer to check the testing for the reducer.
