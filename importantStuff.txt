how to navigate to other page on click of button.
ans: any component which is loaded using the Route object of the react-router, gets some props from the react router.
    which can be accesible via props.
    history is one such method which has data about previous route and it has push method. using the push method we can
    navigate to any route which is defined.
    
    ex: this.props.history.push('/checkout');
