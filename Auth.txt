authentication via firebase:

1) enable authentication in firebase console via email.
2) whenever we make request from the UI, we have to hit below API and pass required data.

rest API endpoint for signup:
    https://www.googleapis.com/identitytoolkit/v3/relyingparty/signupNewUser?key=[API_KEY]
    
    API_KEY: project api key

    refer AuthAction.js for the example.
